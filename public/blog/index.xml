      <description>When we speak to owners and managers of contract security companies, many of them complain about the difficulty of getting new business. A few, however, seem to find it much easier. I going to write about some of the lessons we have learned after dealing with many companies in the industry.
Why it’s Hard to Get New Accounts You really have two choices for new business. You are going to either find a building or organization that does not currently have security services, or you are going to try displace another company that is already providing services to your prospect.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of articles on the web on how to beat your competition, but I thought I would try to look more specifically at the contract security guard industry. I hope you will find this thought provoking and I would love to get any feedback.
Competition is Good – But You Need to Beat It The first thing to remember about competition is that it is good. If you are in a market with a lot of competition, that means there is a need for your product.</description>

      <title>Workforce Management, a Benefit to Everyone Involved</title>

      <description>As we come into 2018, I got to thinking about just how much has changed over the last few years and how much it could continue to change. One of the largest drivers I have seen is the continued automation of many jobs that traditionally did not really have any technical component. I am talking about jobs like security officer, cleaner, maintenance engineer and even home care worker.
Today, customers are no longer assuming that these people are doing their jobs well but rather looking for evidence in the form of some kind of automated reports and this is where Workforce Management comes in.</description>

      <description>Last week, we have the good fortune to talk to Jorge Fernandez, Director of Special Services at Admiral Security Services about some real world security operations where our guard tour system is used. We got some useful insights from the conversation and I thought I would share them with you.
The Value of a Guard Tour System We always wonder where our customers get the greatest value from our products.</description>

      <title>How Artificial Intelligence will Affect the Physical Security Industry</title>

      <description>Artificial Intelligence, or Machine Learning as it is commonly referred to these days, is one of the hottest technologies that is changing the world today. It has been identified as an Exponential Technology by Salim Ismail of Singularity University which means it is a technology for which performance relative to cost and size is doubling every one to two years.
This incredible level of growth has got me thinking how it will affect Workforce Management systems like Guard Tour Systems as well as the physical security industry as a whole.</description>

      <description>What’s your worst nightmare as the owner of a contract security guard company? I imagine it might have something to do with your biggest client phoning you up at 3 a.m. to scream at you about a huge security breach and to tell you your guards are nowhere to be seen. So how do you know if your guards are at their posts and following post order rather than down at the coffee shop getting a quick fix?</description>

      <description>As with many industries, the contract security guard industry has to keep up with the times and that means taking advantage of the latest technology. Part of that may include finding the right guard tour system to track and report on the movement of your security officers when they are on patrol.
In this article I am going to look at some detail about why you need one and what you would expect from this kind of system.</description>

      <title>Choosing the Right Smartphones for Your Security Business</title>

      <description>It is becoming clear that more and more security officers are carrying a smartphone as part of their standard equipment. This sparks the debate regarding whether it is best to supply your employees with iPhones or Android phones. While there are certainly no shortage of articles that generically discuss the merits of each, for example hereand here, I thought I would look at some of the more specific needs of the contract security market as it pertains to choosing iPhones or Androids.</description>

      <title>Effective Reporting for Physical Security</title>
      <link>https://www.kugadi.com/blog/2016/03/16/effective-reporting-for-physical-security/</link>

      <description>For most in the physical security industry, client reporting means simply sending your officer’s daily activity report (DAR) to your customer. While this is a good start, we have observed that reporting in this way, does not give the customer everything they need and want. A more flexible approach to reporting is needed to keep customer satisfaction high. Here are some ideas to help you improve your business.
What Information Customers Want Remember that every customer is different.</description>

      <title>What to Expect from Mobile Apps in the Security Industry</title>

      <description>In the Security Newsdesk article, Physical Security and Cyber Security Predictions for 2016, one of the key predictions is that “Mobility Matters.” The article infers that smartphone applications are becoming more and more important in the general operations of security companies. In fact, they go so far as to say that “customers are redefining their operations around mobility and demanding that it flexes to their needs.” So, I thought I would take a look at what a mobile app can do for a guard company and some ideas of just what you need to consider if you want to start using one in your company.</description>

      <description>During our consulting work in the contract security industry, we are often asked about how to make companies more competitive and more efficient. One of the areas we have discovered that makes a big impact on the efficiency and competitive positioning of companies selling or using security services is the workflow followed by their security guards. We find that the security companies with the most efficient services are using an “automated guard workflow”.</description>

      <description>Technology is changing our world. But which technologies are right for you, your business and your customers? In this article, I am going to explore the advantages and challenges associated with common technologies used in smartphone based guard tour systems for tracking security officer locations and activity.
Global Positioning System (GPS) The technology that springs to mind when discussing tracking, smartphones and maps is GPS. If you own a smart phone, you are familiar with GPS because of applications like Google Maps.</description>

      <description>As part of Officer Assist, our Android based guard tour system, we track the movement of security guards using the phones GPS location. We have collected hundred’s of millions of individual fixes and so we thought it would be interesting to try and find the accuracy of each fix and of phone based GPS in general. What we found may surprise you!
Getting the Raw Data Fortunately for us, the Location API in Android gives us an accuracy figure for each position (see http://developer.</description>
