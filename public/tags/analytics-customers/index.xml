This property is a residential building that does not have a visitor&amp;rsquo;s parking, so visitors constantly park inappropriately creating great discomfort in the residents of the building.
We immediately checked our system and informed the customer that only during the previous month, their officers had generated 193 property violations in the building.</description></item></channel></rss>
