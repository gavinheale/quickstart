    <p>The great advantage of using NFC RFID tags is that they are both simple to use and totally secure.
      It is impossible to copy a tag as the identity we use is built in at the factory.</p>
    <p>These easy to install checkpoints just need to be touched with our mobile app.
      The officer gets custom post instructions associated with the location while at the same time,
      the time and place are automatically sent to the cloud.</p>
    <p>The entire guard tour is tracked in real-time.</p>
